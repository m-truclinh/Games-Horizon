            The year 2017 comes to an end and before we close this year with fireworks we present you a special.
            These are undoubtedly the best games of the year 2017, rated by critics and by ourselves as well. The winner

            When the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR released in 2016, they were derided as being too expensive.
            All three VR headsets have received significant price drops in 2017, however, making them much more accessible.
            VR may still be far from mainstream, but its market share grew steadily in 2017. They are now an affordable
            christmas gift for passionate gamers. For most people still not a reason to buy just yet, ut maybe they can
            get to a wider audience in 2018?

            As the site Destructoid reports, several employees of Motiga have confirmed that the studio will close soon.
            About 50 employees have to look for a new job afterwards. In the past there were regular layoffs, which was
            due to the problematic development of the MOBA shooter Gigantic. Originally the game was to be released by
            Microsoft, but the company ran out of money in 2016. It was only after the acquisition of Perfect World Entertainment
            that Gigantic finally hit the market in July this year. Sadly for everyone participating and players even
            Perfect World Entertainment dropped them. The interest of Perfect World Entertainment was to be profitable and
            Gigantic simply could not generate enough revenue. This moment is incredibly heart-breaking considering the years
            this team has struggled to even get this game out for players to enjoy even though most of them didn't even got paid.
            And not even after 6 months since its launch all developers and employees are now unemployed. This is truly a sad day
            for all Gigantic fans.

            With the newest game developed and published by Electronic Arts: Star Wars Battlefront II, EA thought they
            had the Fans of the IP on their side. But they got surprised by the reactions by gamers which are banding
            together TO NOT BUY the game, which led to low sales and stock market slump even though they had a huge investment,
            marketing campaign. The reason was clearly the microtransactions which basically
            means that if you buy the game for whooping 60-70€ depending in which country you live or currency you use, you
            have to buy in-game items to even compete with other players. This led to huge damage to the image of the company
            which already wasn't the best already. This with the server problems on launch day, led to this situation right now
            with the players and fans against them.

            Samorost 3 is a love letter to classic point-and-click adventure games. You explore your surroundings,
            unearth objects, and then figure out where best to use them. Straightforward stuff, then
            (at least in theory – many puzzles are decidedly cryptic), but what sets Samorost 3 apart is that it’s
            unrelentingly gorgeous, and full of heart.

            a sandbox, dumping you in its universe and having you explore. You go about your day as an inmate, using opportune
            moments to venture into places you shouldn’t, and fashion the tools you need to escape.

            When you need to see the bigger picture, sometimes it's best to return to your roots. Assassin's Creed Origins
            takes this thinking to heart and steps into the seamless and dynamic open world of ancient Egypt. Although
            this move shows glimmers of a brighter future for the series, it also becomes clear that its core gameplay and
            presentation have some difficulties keeping up with the newfound pace and scale.Blurring the lines between prequel
            and sequel, Assassin's Creed Origins takes us back to the beginning of the Assassin Brotherhood, while also
            laying the groundwork for a new present-day storyline. Set during the time of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt,
            you take on the role of Bayek, a Medjay ranger who embarks on a quest for revenge against a mysterious order
            that pre-dates the Templars. Crossing paths with historical figures such as Cleopatra and Julius Caesar,
            Bayek travels through the dense and varied lands of Northern Africa. He'll sneak, loot, and stab key figures in the social
            and political worlds of Egypt, leading to several unforeseen consequences for the future of the Kingdom, right up to present day events.

        <p class="text">
            Over 6,000 games have been released on Steam so far in 2017. We still have a month and a half left in 2017,
            but that number is already huge. This number comes from industry analyst Daniel Ahmad from Niko Partners.
            As Ahmad stated, this 6,000 count is nearly equal to the total number of games released on Steam from 2005 to 2015.
            In 2016, the number sat around 4,200 games released (via GI.biz). Check out the huge climb in releases on Steam that Ahmad compiled:
            Steam Direct, the replacement for the indie program Steam Greenlight implemented this year, likely had a big
            influence on this number. Since its launch, more than 1,000 games have been released (via Kotaku).
            Steam gets a small cut of every game sold, as well as a  $100 fee for every Steam Direct application filed,
            so this 6,000 number can only mean good things for the distributor.

            First the gods bled, and then they fell.
            SK telecom T1’s quest for a three-peat championship was ended by Samsung Galaxy in a thrilling 3-0 match.
            This marks the end to the heartbreak they suffered almost exactly a year ago when they fell short against
            SKT in Los Angeles. Nevertheless Team Samsung Galaxy is clearly the best team in competitive League of Legends
            right now. They played a nearly perfect tournament sweeping the best teams away. It seems like a new era is coming.

            Once again China's best teams could not hold against the Juggernaut's from Korea. It seems that even the home advantage
            couldn't give the chinese teams that what they hoped for, to reach Finals and eventually win Worlds for the first time.
            The first big disappointment for China was that Team EDG couldn't make it out of Group Stages.On Saturday China's
            number 1 seed lost against the worlds undisputed best Team SKT T1. Even if this was a close game with 2-3 match loss,
            it still was a huge disappointment for chinese fans who filled the stadium to the last seat. Today on a Sunday evening
            the last remaining chinese Team WE lost 1-3 against another korean Team Samsung Galaxy. Even the roar of the chinese fans
            in the stadium couldn't give Team WE the mentality boost to win against Samsung Galaxy and the stadium remained
            silent as the korean team won the last game and took a bow before the massive crowd. In the end the Worlds 2017
            League of Legends Finals will be another all korean finals with a rematch from last year between SK Telecom T1
            and Samsung Galaxy. The finals will be held on Saturday the 4th of November 2017 the in the Bird's Nest Stadium in Beijing, China.
            This will be the biggest stadium an E-sports tournament has ever played in.

            Nintendo's most iconic character comes to the Switch in one of his best adventures ever. The long awaited game
            finally comes to the switch for everybody to enjoy. After several hours with the game we from Game's Horizon
             can say that this game is a masterpiece and probably will win Game of the Year Award. The whole game is basically
             like a massive playground. Mario isn't only a plumber in this game, he is a doctor. He’s the lead in a mariachi band.
             He’s a building inspector. He’s eager to fill whatever role the occasion calls for. Super Mario Odyssey
             expands on Mario’s chameleon-esque nature by giving him a new, all-encompassing ability: the power to take
             over and control other characters and enemies by tossing his hat upon their noggin. Also the feeling of traveling
             through lively worlds will give players a desire to travel the world, since it is massive, fun and colourful.
             Nintendo always manageds to show that Video Games are truly an art by itself, especially this game.
             If you don't already have a Switch then this game is a reason to own one yourself.
